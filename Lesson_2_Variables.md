### Variables

The variables are the instruments for saving the content in the memory.
Its structure has the next form:

```html
[type] [key] = [value];
```
From the code above probably you've already tumbled to that JS is typed language, 
but it is allowed not to specify type during the variable initialization.

For example:

```html
const name = 'Harmonia';
// or also possible:
name = 'Harmonia';
```

I hope the author does not mind about this information is located here.
