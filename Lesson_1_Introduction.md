The website **with HTML and CSS is just static website**, without soul, which **never changes**.
For many animations which were created by important graphic designers, 
**it is always the same for returning to the beginning**.

Just right here it is appeared the third mile factor: the **programming languages**.
They give **the possibility to make the pages dynamic**, dependant for changes from the particular moment or user.


We have 2 types:
* **Frontend, logic from the browser side**. Usually it is used JavaScript.
* **Backend**, the pages are **created(painted) with a server**. You could learn more about this topic in [PHP course](https://programadorwebvalencia.com/cursos/php/base/). <br>

**JavaScript** (abbreviation as JS) is a **high level programming language** which was created in 1995 
(it's syntax's is nearer to human then to machine), 
**multi paradigm** (admit varies organization types) and **executed during the compilation**
(there is no previous step of the code compilation into the binary).
All these make your studying and developing easier. <br>

The **goal of this course** is to learn you the essential tasks 
which every professional frontend programmer has to know:

* Manipulation with HTML(DOM).
* Creation dynamic elements.
* Reaction for user actions (events).
* Form management.
* Interaction with other services (APIs). <br>

Are you ready that the users are the main characters?
